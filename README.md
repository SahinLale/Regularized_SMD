# Pytorch Implementation of Regularizer Mirror Descent (RMD) Algorithm on Corrupted CIFAR-10 Dataset

This library provides implementation of Regularizer Mirror Descent (SMD) algorithm with 2-norm potential function. This library can be used to reproduce results of [1].

The initialization point as well as the 10%, 25% and 40% corrupted CIFAR-10 data are in
